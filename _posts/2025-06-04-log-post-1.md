Too much for the past for one to memerize  
Too many words remained for one to read through the lines  
The ebb and flow of the crowd floods the word and paradise  
Along the time    
Every night brings a dream, but the day relentlessly keeps me awake  
All the rest with be torn up whenever a choice is made  
Every living soul in the fray striving for their own safe place  
Life is too long to end at a grave  
Just a drop of a water suffices  
Encompassed and swallowed through space by the universe  
Back to the source  
Gone are those years living for a reason  
Here it comes, the moment of the scene of lost and found  
Personas played out on the stage  
Will return to the self when there's a curtain call  
Every night brings a dream, but the day relentlessly keeps me awake  
All the rest will be torn up whenever a choice is made  
Everyone has their own desire leading to the ultimate  
Life is too long to end at a grave  
Just a drop of a water suffices  
Still, I wish to embrace the world with my thoughts
A eulogy    
Time to leave where I have stood so long  
Letting you go, recover traces overlapped  
Ends, then begins
